# Q5) Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic operations are the basic mathematical operators which are used in our daily life. Mainly it consists of seven operators.


# i. Addition operator --> '+' 
x = 5
y = 3
result = x + y  
print("Addition = ", result) 


# ii. Subtraction operator --> '-'
x = 10
y = 4
result = x - y 
print("Subtraction = ",result) 


# iii. Multiplication operator --> '*' 
x = 7
y = 6
result = x * y 
print("Multiplication = ",result) 


#  iv. Normal Division operator --> '/'
x = 8
y = 2
result = x / y  
print("Division = ",result) 


# v. Modulo Division operator --> '%' 
x = 10
y = 3
result = x % y 
print("Modulo",result) 


# vi. Floor Division operator --> '//' 
x = 9
y = 2
result = x // y  
print("Floor Division = ",result) 


# vii. Exponential operator (or) power operator --> '**'
x = 3
y = 2
result = x ** y 
print("Exponential operator = ",result)
